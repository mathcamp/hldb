hldb is a swifty wrapper ontop of FMDB, which itself is an Objective-C wrapper on top of sqlite.
hldb makes extensive use of reactive programming paradigms like [Promises or futures](https://github.com/Thomvis/BrightFutures).
// Other things? more rationale @benagarr??

## Installation

#### Pods

`pod 'hldb'`

#### Carthage

`github "mathcamp/hldb"`

## Usage Example

### Playground
To get the program to recognize and import the `hldb.framework`, you first need to build the framework itself. To do this
1. Open `hldb.xcworkspace`
2. Select `hldb-iOS` framework as your scheme and build on a device. (this builds the framework)
3. After this you should be able to use `hldb.playground` freely ðŸ˜„

### Example project
@benagarr what do you think? I haven't really done a lot with this
