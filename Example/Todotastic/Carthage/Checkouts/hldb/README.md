To get the program to recognize and import the `hldb.framework`, you first need to build the framework itself. To do this

1. Open `hldb.xcworkspace`

2. Select `hldb-iOS` framework as your scheme and build on a device. (this builds the framework)

3. After this you should be able to use `hldb.playground` freely ðŸ˜„
